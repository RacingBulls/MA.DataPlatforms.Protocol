# Introduction 
This repository contains the protobuf definitions for the Open Data format and Stream API.

# Protobuf standards
In order to comply with Protobuf and gRPC best practice, the build pipeline validates the proto files with a lint tool ([Buf](https://buf.build/)). It is recommended that developers familiarise themselves with the standards ([Buf Style Guide](https://buf.build/docs/best-practices/style-guide)) and install the same tool ([Buf CLI](https://buf.build/docs/installation)) in order to run the checks locally.
